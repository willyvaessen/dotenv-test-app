# Trying dotenv
In another project, I had some trouble using dotenv and my .env file to connect 
to a database.
I haven't been able to figure out yet why that happens, so I decided to build 
this small, simple project. 
I followed the [Quickstart guide](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/quickstart) on 
the [Dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/) website.
